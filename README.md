[J.K. Royston - Password Generator](https://jxhnkndl.github.io/password-generator)

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to program a dynamic password generating application. The application prompts the user to input a series of criteria from which a password will be generated. The user can choose for their password to be anywhere between 8 and 128 characters long. Additionally, users can choose any combination of uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters to use in their password, though they must choose at least one. Based on the criteria selected, the application will generate and output a new random, secure password into the UI for the user.

## Features

* **Password Length:** The user can choose for their password to be anytime from 8 to 128 characters long. If the user inputs a number lower than 8 or higher than 128, they will be prompted to make a valid selection within the given range.
* **Character Types:** The user is prompted to either include or exclude uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character types. The user must select at least one character type for their password to be constructed. The final password generated by the application will contain only characters of those types selected by the used.
* **Unique Passwords:** Because of the way that the passwords are generated, each password is completely unique.
* **Intuitive UI:** With a clean, intuitive UI featuring a single prominent button, the user experience is simple and efficient.

## Design Strategy

I chose to use a slightly modular approach to the application design. Rather than including all of the application logic inside of the `generatePassword()`, I wanted to try to keep the different logical functions at each step self-contained and then simply call them from within the primary function. I wanted to make sure that different pieces of the application could more easily be interacted with or updated in the future. A more modular approach also struck me as an efficient strategy because of the increased reusability of code. 

First, I declared my character array variables at the top of the global scope knowing they may need to be accessible within multiple functions. 

Next, I wrote a `passwordLength()` function with the sole purpose of taking in, validating, and storing the user's numeric password length. This function returns a numeric length when called in `generatePassword()`.

The next logical step was to write a slightly larger `charChoices()` function to prompt, validate, and store which character types the user wants to include in the password. This function also contains the logic necessary to construct a final character array including only those character types included by the user. The function returns this curated character array when called in `generatePassword()`.

I wrote one tiny helped function called `randomNumber()` that could take in a length (should the parameters of the application ever change) and return a random whole number between 0 and that length.

Lastly, the `generatePassword()` function is where everything gets brought together. It fires the initial alert to the user and then calls `passwordLength()` and `charChoices()` and saves their return values to variables. Finally, a simple loops randomly generates numbers that correspond to characters in the final character array and constructs a unique password tailored to the user's specifications.
