[Password Generator - Live Demo](https://jxhnkndl.github.io/password-generator)

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to program a dynamic password generating application. The application will prompt the user with a series criteria from which a password will ultimately be generated. The user can choose for their password to be anywhere between 8 and 128 characters long. Additionally, users can choose any combination of uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters to use in their password, though they must choose at least one character type. Based on the user's selected preferences, the application will generate and output a new random, secure password into the UI for the user.

## Features

* **Password Length:** The user can choose for their password to be anywhere from 8 to 128 characters long. If the user inputs a number lower than 8 or greater than 128, they will be prompted to make a new valid selection within the given range.
* **Character Types:** The user is prompted to either include or exclude uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character types. The user must select at least one character type. The final password generated by the application will contain only characters of those types selected by the used.
* **Unique Passwords:** Because of the way that the passwords are generated using randomizing functions and the specificity of each user's selected preferences, each user password is completely unique and secure.
* **Intuitive UI:** With a clean, intuitive UI featuring a single prominent button, the user experience is simple and efficient.

## Design Notes

I chose to use a more modular approach to the application design. Rather than including all of the application logic inside of the `generatePassword()` function, I chose to separate the core pieces of logic into discrete, modular functions that could be called and return data directly within the `generatePassword()` function. Specifically, I chose to encapsulate the logic required for choosing and validating a password length, choosing and validating character type choices, and randomizing numbers used in the selection of characters for the password. Each of these functions is used within the primary application sequence inside `generatePassword()`.
